# we have just one channel, in which we observe 0 events

------------
# now we list the expected events for signal and all backgrounds in that bin
# the second 'process' line must have a positive number for backgrounds, and 0 for signal
# then we list the independent sources of uncertainties, and give their effect (syst. error)
